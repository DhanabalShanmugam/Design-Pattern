# Builder Pattern
Using Builder Pattern, we can create complex object using simple objects through a step by step approach. This enables us to create multiple representations using the same construction process.

* While Considering the builder pattern you need to look weather the object is having
### Complex constructor.
Multiple constructor having combinations of multiple parameter with nested objects.
### Large number of parameters.
if you having large number of field parameter is also the key point to consider.

## Example
We have a class called __*PersonDetails*__. We have to store the persons details in it. So, We required large number of parameters(like firstName, lastName, fatherName, motherName, age, address, education,work, salary and etc). If you have constructor with large amount of parameter it cause error. So, It is very difficult for customer to create object for __*PersonDetails*__ with more parameter's and it's also require many types of parameterized constructure, because every one want to create a details with different number of parameters( like one person only give a firstName, another person don't want to create give a education and etc). Shortout this problem, we using __*Builder Pattern*__. 

We using __*Getter and Setter*__ methods to implement the __*Builder Pattern*__.
