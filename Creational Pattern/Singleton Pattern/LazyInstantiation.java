# This Program runs clearly, but we had issue some issues.
# Think about multithreading , what happen if two threads call getInstance() at same time.
# Yeah, you are right two object are created. Solve this, we use Synchronization technique.

    // Add synchronized keyword with method name getInstance
    synchronized public static Shop getInstance() {
        // Check the object for, whether previously it created or not 
        if (shopObj == null) {
            shopObj = new Shop();
        }
        return shopObj;
    }

   
# But using above method we have performance issue. So, solve that we use Double Check Locking method. 
# In below, just apply synchronized method divide into the sub part.

public static Shop getInstance() {
        // Check the object for, whether previously it created or not 
        if (shopObj == null) {
           synchronized(Shop.class){
             if(shopObj == null){
                shopObj = new Shop();
              }
            }
        }
        return shopObj;
    }

# Using this, avoid multithreading problem and performance issue.
