# Prototype Pattern
In __*Prototype Pattern*__, we creating new object by cloning the existing one instead of creating new one and customize it as per requirement.

Use the __*Prototype Pattern*__ when creating an instance of a given class either expensive or complicated. 

## Example
Think you are building a game like __*PUBG*__. In the game you have feature, that is can to create your own fighters. For this feature, if your code creating new object everytime for creating the new fighter, it require more time(like you're building a new building from the base). Instead of that if you're copy the pervious fighter and only change the changes you want from exiting fighter(it's like copy the old building and cusomize that you on your wish, like change door color, increase hight of the building etc.), it saves your time and also increase your app performance.
