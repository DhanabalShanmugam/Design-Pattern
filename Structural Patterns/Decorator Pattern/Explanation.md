# Decorator Pattern
 The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
subclassing for extending functionality.

Decorator design patterns allow us to add functionality to an object at runtime, and we can apply this customized functionality to an individual object based on our requirement and choice.

## Example
Suppose, We build a __*Pizza*__ ordering application(like zomato). In it, you have to derive multiple classes for differnent type of Pizza's.

At now, you are derived a classes for Pizza's. But, think in the app, user can specify the ingredient by own(like add extra cheese or toppings).
