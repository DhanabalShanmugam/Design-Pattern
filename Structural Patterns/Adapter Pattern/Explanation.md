# Adapter Pattern
Adapter Pattern convert the interface of a class into another interface the clients expert. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## Example 
Suppose you have __*Dragon*__ class with run() and fire() methods and also a __*Bird*__ class with fly() method. Now, you're decided to create a new __*Dragon*__ called __*FlyingDragon*__. We all are know, __*FlyingDragon*__ have same functionalities of __*Dragon*__, but it's fly instead of run. So, we should add fly() method in a __*Dragon*__ class. But wait, why we should write fly() method once again, because we already written it in a __*Bird__* class, so use it insead of writting it. Yeah, we are going to create a __*FlyingDragon*__ class by using __*Dragon*__ and __*Bird*__ classes. But, both are different class(like, us plugin and indian plug point), how to we connect them. 

__*How to connect tham?*__

Yes, you're right. __*Adapter*__.

To connect __*Dragon*__ and __*Bird*__ classes we create a class called __*Adapter*__. which give you flexibility to access the __*Bird*__ class methods through class the __*Dragon*__ object. For, better understanding see the implementation.
